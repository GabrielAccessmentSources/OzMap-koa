# OzMap Back-End

### Attention:
Running the `yarn start-dev` command will do everything for you, it'll create a database and will seed for you!

If you want a clean database, just comment the ``mockData`` promise.

Unfortunately the only way to drop the DB is using tools like BKeeper with SQL.

## Steps

### 1 Clone the app using:
### `git clone <repourl>`

### 2 Make sure you have yarn installed otherwise install using the second command:
### ``yarn --version``
### ``npm install --global yarn``

### 3 Install the required Libraries using:
### `yarn install` or simply `yarn`

### 5 Run the command:
### `yarn start-dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

### 6 To run the tests use:
### ``yarn test``
